# Module electricity_bidding_data
This module is responsible for extacting semo data, transforming it into features. Currently it uses a single parquet file as databases which seems reasonable given the data is small.

Run tests using`run_tests.sh`.

## AWS Deployment
The module is deployed using Lambda functions since the data is small and we expect it to run in seconds. See `tf/electricity_bidding_tf/extract_semo.tf` which contains the terraform for the lambda, step functions and the reqired roles, policies etc.
